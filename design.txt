Pseudocode

  CalculateArea
    initialize shape to ""
    initialize length to 0
    initialize length2 to 0
    initialize width to 0
    initialize height to 0
    initialize radius to 0
    initialize area to 0
    
    prompt for shape with "Please enter a shape"
    
    IF shape = square
      prompt for length
      calculate area using length * length
      display length, area, and thank user for participating
    ELSE IF shape = rectangle OR parallelogram
      prompt for length and width
      calculate area using length * width
      display length, width, area, and thank user for participating
    ELSE IF shape = circle
      prompt for radius
      calculate area using Math.PI * radius
      display radius, area, and thank user for participating
    ELSE IF shape = triangle
      prompt for length and height
      calculate area using (length * height) / 2
      display length, height, area, and thank user for participating
    ELSE IF shape = trapezoid
      prompt for length 1, length 2 and height
      calculate area using ((length1 * length 2) * height) / 2
      display length 1, length 2, height, area, and thank user for participating
    ELSE
      display shape + "is not a valid shape.  Please enter a shape."
    END IF
  END
